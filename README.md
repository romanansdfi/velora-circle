# Velora Circle

Build a premium, production-quality frontend web application called "Velora Circle".

Velora Circle is a privacy-first collaboration platform combining:

- Private 1-to-1 messaging

- Private group conversations ("Circles")

- Video/audio meetings

- Scheduled meetings

- Secure file sharing

- Team/workspace collaboration

The core differentiating feature is PRIVACY:

Normal members must NOT see:

- Total number of members in a Circle

- Full member directory

- Online member count

- Who joined or left

- Any unnecessary participant statistics

Only Owners/Admins with the appropriate permissions can see/manage member information.

IMPORTANT:

This is a frontend UI project. Build the interface with realistic mock data and reusable components. Do not build fake backend functionality. All interactions should feel functional through frontend state, modals, dropdowns, navigation, and sample data.

==================================================

DESIGN DIRECTION

==================================================

Make the product feel like a premium combination of:

- Linear

- Slack

- Discord

- Notion

- modern private banking software

Do NOT make it look like a basic Bootstrap dashboard or generic SaaS template.

Visual style:

- Premium

- Minimal

- Sophisticated

- Privacy-focused

- Modern

- Slightly futuristic

- Clean

- Professional enough for enterprise users

Use:

- Deep navy / charcoal foundation

- Soft white text

- Subtle blue accents

- Very limited violet/cyan accents

- Glassmorphism only where appropriate

- Soft borders

- Large but controlled border radius

- Subtle shadows

- Elegant gradients

- Smooth micro-interactions

Avoid:

- Excessive gradients

- Too many colors

- Huge cards

- Clutter

- Cartoonish illustrations

- Excessive avatars

Typography:

Use Inter, Manrope, or Satoshi.

Strong hierarchy.

Large clean headings.

Comfortable spacing.

Icons:

Use Lucide icons or another consistent SVG icon system.

==================================================

Desktop:

3-column layouts where appropriate.

Tablet:

Collapse secondary panels.

Mobile:

Bottom navigation.

Mobile navigation:

Home

Messages

Circles

Meetings

Profile

Chat should become full-screen.

Meeting controls should be optimized for touch.

Sidebar becomes a drawer.

==================================================

18. MICRO-INTERACTIONS

==================================================

Add subtle animations:

- Sidebar transitions

- Page transitions

- Button hover

- Message appearance

- Modal opening

- Dropdown animation

- Toast notifications

- Active navigation indicator

- Skeleton loading states

Keep animations fast and sophisticated.

No excessive bouncing animations.

==================================================

Tooltip

Toast

Card

Input

Textarea

Search

Sidebar

Navbar

MessageComposer

ConversationItem

Use reusable components instead of duplicating UI.

==================================================

20. ACCESSIBILITY

==================================================

Include:

- Keyboard navigation

- Focus states

- ARIA labels

- Proper contrast

- Tooltips for unfamiliar icons

- Accessible modals

- Screen-reader-friendly buttons

==================================================

21. IMPORTANT PRIVACY UX RULE

==================================================

The privacy model must be visually obvious but never feel broken.

For normal members:

DO NOT show:

Member count

Online count

Full member list

"X people in this group"

Instead use subtle language:

"Private Circle"

"Restricted member visibility"

"Member directory hidden"

The application should feel intentionally private.

For Admin/Owner:

Allow access to member management and statistics through a dedicated management panel.

==================================================

22. PREMIUM DETAILS

==================================================

Add small details that make the application feel expensive:

- Thin 1px borders

- Soft background gradients

- Frosted glass modal surfaces

- Subtle hover elevation

- Smooth icon transitions

- Consistent 8px spacing system

- Rounded 12–18px cards

- Clean separators

- Carefully designed empty states

- Elegant skeleton loaders

- Toast notifications

- Keyboard shortcuts

- Command palette

- Persistent theme preference

Use dark mode as the primary experience.

Also provide Light Mode.

==================================================

23. COLOR SYSTEM

==================================================

Primary background:

Deep navy / near-black.

Surface:

Slightly lighter navy.

Primary accent:

Electric blue.

Secondary accent:

Subtle violet/cyan.

Destructive:

Muted red.

Success:

Muted green.

Do not use bright colors everywhere.

The interface should look premium even when there is very little content.

==================================================

24. BRANDING

==================================================

Brand:

VELORA CIRCLE

Tagline:

"Private conversations. Focused collaboration."

Alternative short tagline:

"Connect privately. Collaborate confidently."

Use a minimal V-shaped SVG mark.

Do not use generic chat bubble branding.

==================================================

25. FINAL QUALITY REQUIREMENT

==================================================

The final result must look like a real startup product ready for a premium SaaS launch.

It should NOT look like:

- A student project

- A template

- A generic admin dashboard

- A clone of WhatsApp

- A clone of Discord

- A basic CRUD application

The design should communicate:

PRIVACY

TRUST

PREMIUM

COLLABORATION

FOCUS

SECURITY

Prioritize visual hierarchy, whitespace, typography, interaction quality, and consistency.

Use realistic sample content so every page looks populated and production-ready.

==================================================

26. CROSS-PLATFORM RESPONSIVE EXPERIENCE

==================================================

This application must be fully responsive and optimized for:

- Windows laptops

- MacBook

- Desktop monitors

- iPhone

- Android phones

- iPad

- Android tablets

This is NOT a desktop website that simply shrinks on mobile.

The interface must adapt its layout, navigation, spacing,

controls, typography, and interactions based on screen size.

==================================================

DESKTOP EXPERIENCE — LAPTOP / MACBOOK / DESKTOP

==================================================

For screens >= 1024px:

Use the full application layout:

┌──────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬──────────────┐

│              │                               │              │

│   SIDEBAR    │        MAIN CONTENT           │   OPTIONAL   │

│              │                               │   PANEL      │

│              │                               │              │

└──────────────┴───────────────────────────────┴──────────────┘

Sidebar:

240–280px

Main content:

Flexible

Right panel:

280–360px when required

Allow sidebar collapse.

Use keyboard shortcuts.

Support:

Ctrl + K

Cmd + K

for global search.

Desktop should make maximum use of available screen

space without becoming visually crowded.

==================================================

TABLET EXPERIENCE — IPAD / ANDROID TABLET

==================================================

For screens between approximately 768px and 1023px:

- Sidebar becomes collapsible

- Main content remains primary

- Right panels become drawers

- Chat remains comfortable for touch

- Buttons have larger touch targets

- Meeting controls remain easily accessible

- Avoid tiny desktop-style controls

For iPad landscape:

Allow a two-panel experience when space permits.

For iPad portrait:

Use a single primary content panel with drawers.

==================================================

MOBILE EXPERIENCE — IPHONE / ANDROID

==================================================

For screens below approximately 768px:

DO NOT simply scale down the desktop interface.

Create a dedicated mobile layout.

Navigation becomes a bottom navigation bar:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│                                         │

│              MAIN CONTENT               │

│                                         │

│                                         │

├─────────────────────────────────────────┤

│  Home   Messages   Circles   Meetings  │

│                              Profile    │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Bottom navigation:

Home

Messages

Circles

Meetings

Profile

Use SVG icons with labels.

The bottom navigation should:

- Stay accessible

- Respect iPhone safe-area insets

- Work correctly with Android navigation areas

- Never cover message input or important content

==================================================

MOBILE CHAT EXPERIENCE

==================================================

Chat becomes full-screen.

Header:

Composer stays near the bottom:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ +  Message...              🎤    ➤      │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Use actual SVG icons instead of emoji.

The keyboard must not cover the message composer.

Use mobile-safe viewport behavior.

==================================================

MOBILE MEETING JOIN FLOW

==================================================

Create a simple mobile join screen:

          Velora Circle

       Product Strategy

       Private Meeting

       Camera preview

       [ Join Meeting ]

       Microphone

       Camera

Keep the experience extremely simple.

==================================================

MOBILE SIDEBAR / DRAWER

Mobile and tablet controls must have comfortable

touch targets.

Minimum target size:

44px × 44px where practical.

Add:

- Swipe gestures where useful

- Long press actions

- Bottom sheets

- Touch-friendly menus

- Pull-to-refresh style interaction where appropriate

as a Progressive Web App.

Include:

- Mobile-friendly viewport

- App-like navigation

- Installable architecture

- Offline-friendly shell where possible

- Splash/loading experience

- Proper app icons

- Responsive layouts

The application should feel like a native mobile app

when opened on a phone.

==================================================

DESKTOP + MOBILE DESIGN PRINCIPLE

==================================================

Desktop should feel like:

"Professional workspace"

Mobile should feel like:

"Private communication app"

Both must clearly feel like the same Velora Circle product.

Do not create two completely different visual identities.

Maintain the same:

- Typography

- Colors

- Icons

- Brand

- Components

- Privacy language

- Interaction principles

across every device.
